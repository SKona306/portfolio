  <h2><span class="emphasis">About me:</span></h2>
  <p style="text-indent:2em;">Hello, my name is Shaun Kent, Im 24 years old and currently reside in southwest Washington. I grew up in and currently still live in a small town 20 minutes outside of Portland called Battle Ground. I graduated from university in 2019 with a bachelors in Public Affairs, after spending a couple years working I realized that I didn't have a passion for politics. I've always been fascinated with technology both in terms of its growth and potential which has pushed me to start my path towards becoming a web developer. I hope to combine the knowledge that I obtained about public policy with the experience that I have as a web developer to create well designed, functional, and accessible websites.</p>
