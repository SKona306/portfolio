  <h2><span class="emphasis">About me:</span></h2>
  <p style="text-indent:2em;">Hello, my name is Shaun Kent, Im 24 years old and currently reside in southwest Washington. I grew up in and currently still live in a small town 20 minutes outside of Portland called Battle Ground. Some of my interests include basketball, cryptocurrency, and astrophysics just to name a few. At the current moment I am employed as a cook but in past I have had the opportunity to work as a student mentor, student diversity correspondent and tutor. I graduated from university in 2019 with a bachelors in Public Affairs, after spending a couple years working I realized that I didn't have a passion for politics. I've always been fascinated with technology both in terms of its growth and potential which has pushed me to start my path towards becoming a web developer. I hope to combine the knowledge that I obtained about public policy with the experience that I have as a web developer to create well designed, functional, and accessible websites.Thank you for checking out my portfolio.</p>
